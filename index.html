    <p>Ms. Yan ZHANG studies at the Department of Sociology at the University of Oxford. Her focus is on fatherhood and the wellbeing of the left-behind children who are involved in migration process, especially those experiencing internal migration in China, a form of migration that embedded in the unique social and political context of Chinaâ€™s rural-urban segregation. She also studies how the clash between traditional gender norms and the new changes brought by the feminisation of migration plays a role in family relationships from a gender perspective, especially how that is associated with outcomes in children.  
        Yan has a Master of Social Work from Columbia University in the United States, and a MSc in Social Research Methods from the University of Warwick. Yan has worked in New York, Laos and China, and in UNDP and UNICEF before pursuing her DPhil in Sociology. </p>
